# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

##### Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project II
### General description of the project!
I will analyze data related to bike-sharing programs for three major cities in the U.S.â€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington in this project. Using Python, I will write a code to import the data by calculating descriptive statistics and address interesting questions about it. I'll also write a script that contains raw data to create an immersive terminal interface to show those statistics.
### List of what software, firmware and hardware do i need ?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:
- Python
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
- A terminal application
### Installation instructions for the software
